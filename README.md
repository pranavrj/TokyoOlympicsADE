## Tokyo Olympics Azure Data Engineering

Created an end to end data engineering project where I ingested data using API connection from Azure Data Factory and pushed the data into Azure Data lake storage. 
Azure Databricks was used to perform basic transformations like removing nulls/duplicates, schema checks and creating new calculated fields using PySpark. 
Data was written back into ADLS and then added into a SQL Database within Azure Synapse analytics for further analytics using SQL.
